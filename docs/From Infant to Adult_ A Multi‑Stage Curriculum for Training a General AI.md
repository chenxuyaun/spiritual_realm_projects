# From Infant to Adult: A Multi‑Stage Curriculum for Training a General AI

Developing an AI that learns **from scratch** in a human-like progression—starting as an “infant” with basic perception and eventually maturing to an “adult” with advanced cognitive abilities—requires a **multi-stage training curriculum**. This approach draws inspiration from **developmental psychology** and **cognitive developmental robotics**, where an agent’s learning is staged similarly to human growth[[1]](https://techxplore.com/news/2025-12-infant-framework-robots-interact.html#:~:text=without%20requiring%20extensive%20prior%20training)[[2]](https://nam.ai.princeton.edu/events/2025/cognitive-robotics-babies-robots-and-ai#:~:text=collaboration,Theory%20of%20Mind%20and%20its). In this report, we outline the stages of such a training process (vision, language, and higher cognition), survey relevant research projects, discuss datasets and methods for each stage, and recommend architectures, tools, and environments for implementation. A summary of each developmental stage, its focus, and example methods is given in **Table 1** below.

*Table 1: Overview of the staged training curriculum, aligning AI learning stages with human developmental phases, focus areas, example data, and training methods.*

## Stage 1: Visual Learning (Infant Perception)

**Focus:** In the first stage, the AI agent learns to perceive and understand the visual world much like an infant. Human babies initially develop abilities such as tracking objects, recognizing simple shapes/faces, and grasping basic physical concepts (e.g. that objects persist even when unseen). Correspondingly, the AI’s training should start with **visual perception**, aiming for representations of objects and physics grounded in raw sensory data.

**Datasets & Tasks:** A highly relevant dataset for this stage is **SAYCam**, a collection of longitudinal infant-perspective videos with head-mounted cameras[[3]](https://www.emergentmind.com/topics/saycam-dataset#:~:text=,inspired%20pretraining%20frameworks%20like%20BabyVLM). SAYCam captures what an infant **sees** (and hears) during daily activities, providing a naturalistic stream of images from a baby’s viewpoint[[6]](https://www.emergentmind.com/topics/saycam-dataset#:~:text=1,the%20SAYCam%20Dataset). Training on such egocentric video can help an AI model develop rudimentary vision skills under conditions analogous to a human infant’s visual experience. Researchers have also introduced benchmarks inspired by infant cognition – for example, the NIH *Baby Toolkit* includes a *Visual Delayed Response* task, which tests **object permanence** by asking the model to predict where an object will reappear after being occluded[[4]](https://www.emergentmind.com/topics/nih-baby-toolbox#:~:text=Visual%20Delayed%20Response%20Video,prediction). This mimics the classic infant cognitive test of understanding that objects continue to exist when hidden. Similarly, DeepMind’s “Intuitive Physics” curriculum adopted the *violation-of-expectation* paradigm from developmental psychology to train and evaluate models on concepts like object solidity and continuity[[9]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9489531/#:~:text=and%20machines%20by%20drawing%20on,both%20for%20AI%20and%20for). In that work, Piloto et al. (2022) open-sourced a video dataset of simple animated scenarios (balls rolling behind occluders, etc.) and showed that a deep learning model could learn a range of physical concepts directly from pixel input[[9]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9489531/#:~:text=and%20machines%20by%20drawing%20on,both%20for%20AI%20and%20for)[[10]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9489531/#:~:text=Piloto%20et%20al,as%20object%20solidity%20and%20persistence). Notably, their model began to capture basic **common-sense physics** (such as understanding that objects don’t vanish spontaneously), although still not to the full extent of a human infant.

**Simulation Methods:** At this stage, the training can largely rely on **self-supervised learning** or simple supervised signals. For instance, the agent might learn by predicting future frames in video or by auto-encoding images, which encourages it to form an internal model of the visual world. Such *predictive learning* aligns with theories like the Free Energy Principle – the idea that brains learn by predicting sensory inputs and minimizing surprise[[11]](https://neurosciencenews.com/ai-toddler-learning-28382/#:~:text=The%20system%20is%20inspired%20by,difference%20between%20prediction%20and%20observation). An AI model embodying this idea was demonstrated by researchers at OIST, who used a **PV-RNN (Predictive Coding Variational RNN)** to integrate vision and predict outcomes, mirroring toddler-level pattern learning[[7]](https://neurosciencenews.com/ai-toddler-learning-28382/#:~:text=By%20contrast%2C%20the%20new%20model,%E2%80%9D). Additionally, **curiosity-driven learning** can be employed: the agent is given an intrinsic reward for exploring novel inputs or for improving its prediction accuracy. This technique, inspired by human curiosity, has been shown to let robots **self-organize a curriculum** – e.g. a robot might first play with easy-to-manipulate objects and gradually progress to harder ones as its competence grows[[12]](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume23/21-0808/21-0808.pdf#:~:text=,This).

Crucially, Stage 1 should also establish foundational representations that later stages will build upon. For example, a vision model (such as a convolutional neural network or Vision Transformer) trained in this stage can serve as the “eyes” of the agent in subsequent phases. Some projects in **cognitive developmental robotics** combine vision with other infant-like sensory learning; for instance, Yan et al. (2026) integrate **tactile sensors and proprioception** in a meta-learning framework inspired by infant development[[13]](https://techxplore.com/news/2025-12-infant-framework-robots-interact.html#:~:text=The%20team%27s%20framework%20draws%20from,proprioception)[[14]](https://techxplore.com/news/2025-12-infant-framework-robots-interact.html#:~:text=,competitive%20generalization%2C%20resilience%2C%20and%20scalability). Their robot learns how applying force affects objects (a *space–force* understanding akin to a baby pushing or grabbing things), and the framework continually optimizes as the robot gains new experiences[[15]](https://techxplore.com/news/2025-12-infant-framework-robots-interact.html#:~:text=,based%20on%20new%20physical%20interactions). This highlights that early-stage learning need not be purely visual – it can be multi-sensory – but vision is a natural first focus since human infants rely heavily on sight in the first year.

**Outcomes:** By the end of Stage 1, the AI agent should possess an **embodied visual model** of the world. In practical terms, it would recognize common objects in its environment, understand simple spatial relations, and have latent knowledge of physical rules like object permanence. These abilities form the bedrock for more complex communication and reasoning later. Researchers evaluate success at this stage by comparing the AI’s visual cognition to infants: for example, whether a model “gets surprised” (via prediction error) when an object seemingly vanishes, similarly to how a baby stares longer at impossible events[[9]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9489531/#:~:text=and%20machines%20by%20drawing%20on,both%20for%20AI%20and%20for). In summary, Stage 1 establishes the **perceptual commonsense** of an infant in the AI, creating a foundation for subsequent learning.

## Stage 2: Language and Sound Learning (Toddlerhood)

**Focus:** In Stage 2, the agent learns **communication through sound and language**, mirroring how human toddlers acquire speech and basic language skills. Once the AI has visual grounding from Stage 1, we introduce spoken language input and output. The goal is for the AI to map words to concepts (often guided by visual context) and to develop the ability to understand and generate language in an interactive, conversational manner.

**Research and Projects:** This developmental step aligns with research in **language acquisition modeling**. For example, Angelo Cangelosi and colleagues in developmental robotics have studied how robots can learn early **word meanings** and even rudimentary grammar by associating words with sensory experiences[[2]](https://nam.ai.princeton.edu/events/2025/cognitive-robotics-babies-robots-and-ai#:~:text=collaboration,Theory%20of%20Mind%20and%20its). In one case, a humanoid baby robot (iCub) was used to learn object names and simple phrases through social interaction, demonstrating how **embodiment biases** (having a physical presence) can aid word learning[[2]](https://nam.ai.princeton.edu/events/2025/cognitive-robotics-babies-robots-and-ai#:~:text=collaboration,Theory%20of%20Mind%20and%20its). Another notable project is **Mark Sagar’s BabyX**, a virtual infant avatar equipped with cameras and microphones that allow it to “see” and “listen” like a human baby[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BabyX#:~:text=reacts%20like%20a%20human%20baby,4). BabyX uses AI algorithms to learn from those inputs – for instance, it can learn to recognize objects or even to read simple words displayed to it[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BabyX#:~:text=reacts%20like%20a%20human%20baby,4). This shows an implemented example of an AI agent that undergoes a child-like multimodal learning process, with BabyX’s virtual brain responding to visual and auditory stimuli to mimic a toddler’s learning curve.

**Datasets:** For language learning, the AI’s training data should approximate the **child-directed speech** that human toddlers hear. One rich resource is the **CHILDES** corpus, a database of transcripts of real parent–child conversations (and other child-directed utterances). These transcripts contain the simplified syntax, slow pace, and repetition characteristic of how adults speak to young children[[5]](https://www.thetransmitter.org/neuroai/the-babylm-challenge-in-search-of-more-efficient-learning-algorithms-researchers-look-to-infants/#:~:text=at%20the%20sentence%20or%20document,and%20his%20collaborators%E2%80%99%20focus%20on). In fact, the recent *BabyLM Challenge* (2023–2024) has assembled datasets on the order of 10–100 million words – closer to what a child is exposed to in early years, as opposed to the billions of words used to train large language models – to encourage the development of language models that can learn efficiently from limited, child-like input[[17]](https://www.thetransmitter.org/neuroai/the-babylm-challenge-in-search-of-more-efficient-learning-algorithms-researchers-look-to-infants/#:~:text=This%20question%20is%20the%20inspiration,test%20set%20to%20assess%20performance)[[18]](https://www.thetransmitter.org/neuroai/the-babylm-challenge-in-search-of-more-efficient-learning-algorithms-researchers-look-to-infants/#:~:text=Typical%20LM%20training%20sets%20include,2%2C000%20words%20per%20second%2C%2024%2F7). Participants found that incorporating **developmental patterns** (like introducing vocabulary in stages, akin to how children learn simple words before complex ones) can improve data efficiency[[19]](https://www.thetransmitter.org/neuroai/the-babylm-challenge-in-search-of-more-efficient-learning-algorithms-researchers-look-to-infants/#:~:text=O)[[20]](https://www.thetransmitter.org/neuroai/the-babylm-challenge-in-search-of-more-efficient-learning-algorithms-researchers-look-to-infants/#:~:text=Rather%20than%20ordering%20text%20by,They%20found). For audio (speech waveforms), one can use recordings of caregivers talking to children. The **SAYCam** dataset mentioned earlier also includes synchronized audio: it contains not only what the infant sees but also what the infant hears, with many clips of *child-directed speech* from caregivers[[21]](https://www.emergentmind.com/topics/saycam-dataset#:~:text=The%20SAYCam%20dataset%20consists%20of,early%20language%20and%20reasoning%20development)[[22]](https://www.emergentmind.com/topics/saycam-dataset#:~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20BabyVLM%2C,13%20Apr%202025). This enables creation of paired **image–utterance** examples, e.g. a frame of a “dog” in view while the parent says “Look at the dog!” – an ideal scenario for the AI to learn word–object associations. In research practice, Wang et al. (2025) used SAYCam to train a vision-language model dubbed *BabyVLM*, filtering the data to ~67k high-quality image–utterance pairs focusing on simple words and concrete concepts[[22]](https://www.emergentmind.com/topics/saycam-dataset#:~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20BabyVLM%2C,13%20Apr%202025). They even designed evaluation tasks like a “two-word phrase matching” test (to see if the model understands combinations like “wash cup” vs “fill cup”) and a simplified captioning task where the model describes an image in baby-like speech[[23]](https://www.emergentmind.com/topics/saycam-dataset#:~:text=Benchmark%20Description%20Developmental%20Rationale%20Labeled,directed%20captions%20for%20images%2C%20using). These tasks mirror milestones in child language development (two-word stage, simple descriptions) and provide a benchmark for the AI’s linguistic progress.

**Learning Approach:** Technically, Stage 2 introduces **multimodal learning**. The agent’s visual model from Stage 1 can now be coupled with an **audio/language model**. A straightforward architecture is to use a **Transformer** or recurrent neural network that processes language (and possibly another that processes audio spectrograms if working from raw speech), then fuse information from the visual encoder and the language encoder. For instance, a transformer-based **vision-language model** could take an image embedding and predict the appropriate caption (or conversely, take a spoken phrase and predict which image it refers to). A concrete example is found in the toddler-like PV-RNN model by OIST: it simultaneously integrated **vision, proprioception, and language instructions** during training[[24]](https://neurosciencenews.com/ai-toddler-learning-28382/#:~:text=prompt). In their setup, the system would see a video of a robotic arm moving colored blocks and get a sentence like “put red on blue,” and the model had to learn to either produce the correct action sequence or the correct description[[7]](https://neurosciencenews.com/ai-toddler-learning-28382/#:~:text=By%20contrast%2C%20the%20new%20model,%E2%80%9D). This joint training forced the AI to align linguistic commands with visual observations and motor actions, much as a child learns language in the context of manipulating objects. The result was an AI that demonstrated **compositional generalization** (understanding novel combinations of known words and concepts) in a way analogous to a toddler – for example, learning the concept “red” across many contexts and then correctly applying it to a new object[[25]](https://neurosciencenews.com/ai-toddler-learning-28382/#:~:text=It%20is%20thanks%20to%20this,better%20it%20learns%20that%20word).

In addition to supervised multimodal training, the agent can practice **babbling** and conversational turn-taking. A robot might start by outputting random syllables and adjust them based on parental reinforcement (an approach taken in some robotic language experiments). The *BabyAI* gridworld platform can be helpful here, as it includes a simulated **teacher agent** and a series of tasks expressed in a synthetic language[[26]](https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJeXCo0cYX#:~:text=BabyAI%20research%20platform%2C%20with%20the,efficient%20in%20the). The tasks range from simple (“go to red ball”) to complex instructions, and the curriculum of 19 levels gradually teaches the agent a richer grammar and vocabulary[[26]](https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJeXCo0cYX#:~:text=BabyAI%20research%20platform%2C%20with%20the,efficient%20in%20the). Such a platform allows an AI to learn through **interactive dialogue**: the bot teacher gives an instruction, and the agent tries to execute it, receiving feedback. This mimics the way a human child might learn language interactively (through guided play and instruction).

**Outcomes:** By the end of Stage 2, the AI should be able to **understand and produce basic language** grounded in context. It would know, for instance, the names of everyday objects it saw in Stage 1, be able to follow simple spoken commands, and ask or answer simple questions. A successful outcome would be an agent that can carry out a rudimentary conversation about its immediate environment (e.g., see a cat and respond to “What is that?” with “It’s a cat.”). Empirically, one could test the agent on tasks like *Looking While Listening* (point to the correct object image when hearing its name)[[4]](https://www.emergentmind.com/topics/nih-baby-toolbox#:~:text=Visual%20Delayed%20Response%20Video,prediction) or have it play an “I Spy” game in a simulated room. Recent results show that even relatively small models, when trained on child-level multimodal data, can achieve non-trivial performance: for example, **BabyLLaVA-V2**, a vision-language model trained from scratch on SAYCam, was able to reach over 90% accuracy on some spatial reasoning tasks and basic counting, though it still struggled with more complex language or extensive memory tasks[[27]](https://www.emergentmind.com/topics/nih-baby-toolbox#:~:text=match%20at%20L177%20%2A%20BabyLLaVA,based%20object%20permanence%20tasks). This suggests that an appropriately engineered Stage 2 can yield an AI that, while not as verbose as GPT-4, can communicate and learn like a young child, setting the stage for more advanced learning.

## Stage 3: Advanced Cognition and Lifelong Learning (School Age and Beyond)

**Focus:** In the final stage, the now language-capable agent is ready for “school” – i.e. systematic knowledge acquisition and skill diversification. This stage spans a broad range of **cognitive development**, from approximately age 6 (when humans start formal schooling) through adolescence and into continuous adult learning. For the AI, the emphasis here is on **multi-task learning**, **abstract reasoning**, and the ability to continuously learn new things (lifelong learning). In practical terms, the agent will tackle academic-style knowledge (reading and writing, math, world facts) and complex problem-solving, all while integrating the sensory and language skills gained earlier.

**Multi-Task and Transfer Learning:** One hallmark of human learning is the ability to transfer knowledge across domains – what you learn in math class might help in physics class, for example. Likewise, the AI should leverage knowledge from Stage 1 and 2 to excel at new tasks. Modern AI research provides a glimpse of this with **generalist models**. A prominent example is **DeepMind’s Gato**, a single transformer-based model trained on **604 different tasks** spanning vision, language, and control domains[[28]](https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/13/deepminds-new-ai-can-perform-over-600-tasks-from-playing-games-to-controlling-robots/#:~:text=Gato%20is%20what%20DeepMind%20describes,arm%20and%20playing%20Atari%20games). Gato can play Atari games, caption images, chat with a user, and even control a real robot arm – all with one unified network[[28]](https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/13/deepminds-new-ai-can-perform-over-600-tasks-from-playing-games-to-controlling-robots/#:~:text=Gato%20is%20what%20DeepMind%20describes,arm%20and%20playing%20Atari%20games)[[29]](https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/13/deepminds-new-ai-can-perform-over-600-tasks-from-playing-games-to-controlling-robots/#:~:text=trained%20Gato%20to%20complete%20604%2C,arm%20and%20playing%20Atari%20games). While Gato is not explicitly a developmental curriculum (it was trained on tasks simultaneously), it demonstrates that a single AI system *can* acquire a wide repertoire of skills when given diverse experiences. The key to such multitask models is often a shared architecture (e.g. a transformer that processes a sequence of “tokens” which might represent words, image patches, or robot actions)[[30]](https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/13/deepminds-new-ai-can-perform-over-600-tasks-from-playing-games-to-controlling-robots/#:~:text=Like%20all%20AI%20systems%2C%20Gato,sentence%20might%20make%20grammatical%20sense). By converting all sorts of data (text, images, sensor readings) into a common token representation, Gato learned to **generalize** patterns across tasks[[30]](https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/13/deepminds-new-ai-can-perform-over-600-tasks-from-playing-games-to-controlling-robots/#:~:text=Like%20all%20AI%20systems%2C%20Gato,sentence%20might%20make%20grammatical%20sense). For instance, training on both language and robotics might allow some transfer of reasoning skills between the two. In a staged training approach, we would introduce varied tasks gradually – akin to a school curriculum where subjects get added over time. Early in Stage 3, the agent might learn basic arithmetic and reading comprehension; later, it could tackle science questions, strategic games, or even creative tasks like music composition, each time building on prior knowledge. *Transfer learning* can be employed by initializing the agent’s model with the weights from Stage 2 (which has visual and language understanding) and then fine-tuning or expanding it for new tasks, rather than starting from scratch for each new ability. This approach has precedent: many vision-and-language models pre-trained on images and captions have been successfully adapted to downstream tasks like visual question answering or navigation by fine-tuning with relatively small task-specific datasets, showing strong transfer.

**Lifelong / Continual Learning:** A major research area relevant to Stage 3 is **continual (lifelong) learning**, where an AI learns tasks sequentially, as a human would throughout schooling and life, without forgetting the earlier tasks. Humans exhibit *incremental learning* naturally – we retain old skills while adding new ones – but neural networks tend to suffer from *catastrophic forgetting* (where learning a new task disrupts performance on earlier tasks). Tackling this is essential for a true developmental AI that will keep learning into “adulthood.” Researchers Meng et al. (2025) emphasize that lifelong learning is *“considered an essential mechanism that makes up general intelligence,”* yet most AI systems lack this capability[[31]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-025-00983-2?error=cookies_not_supported&code=71a0ef84-ae7f-443f-95d7-1b5fd723e79d#:~:text=Humans%20can%20continually%20accumulate%20knowledge,of%20tasks%20by%20integrating%20language)[[32]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-025-00983-2?error=cookies_not_supported&code=71a0ef84-ae7f-443f-95d7-1b5fd723e79d#:~:text=%E2%80%98lifelong%20learning%E2%80%99,time%20feeding%20tasks). In their work, they present a **robotic Lifelong Reinforcement Learning (LRL) framework** in which an embodied agent faces a never-ending stream of tasks and must accumulate knowledge to solve increasingly complex goals[[33]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-025-00983-2?error=cookies_not_supported&code=71a0ef84-ae7f-443f-95d7-1b5fd723e79d#:~:text=the%20lack%20of%20lifelong%20learning,framework%20that%20is%20well%20suited)[[34]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-025-00983-2?error=cookies_not_supported&code=71a0ef84-ae7f-443f-95d7-1b5fd723e79d#:~:text=illustrates%20the%20training%20process%20for,consistently%20accumulating%20knowledge%20and%20skills). Figure 1 illustrates this concept: rather than having access to all training tasks at once, the agent encounters tasks one after another, mastering each in turn and *building on* this experience to tackle later tasks that may require combining skills[[35]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-025-00983-2/figures/1?error=cookies_not_supported&code=58da2cba-6f41-4c61-9db1-cfb1cbe4e497#:~:text=a%2C%20Overview%20illustration%20of%20the,and%20reapplication%20of%20acquired%20knowledge). Crucially, the agent is able to reuse and recombine learned skills (e.g. knowing how to “pick up objects” and “open doors” allows it to solve a new task “pick up an object from inside a cupboard”)[[35]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-025-00983-2/figures/1?error=cookies_not_supported&code=58da2cba-6f41-4c61-9db1-cfb1cbe4e497#:~:text=a%2C%20Overview%20illustration%20of%20the,and%20reapplication%20of%20acquired%20knowledge). To achieve this, various techniques are employed in continual learning research. These include **regularization methods** (penalizing changes to weights that were important for old tasks), **modular architectures** (separating the network into task-specific components to avoid interference), and **experience replay** (storing past examples and mixing them in when learning new tasks to refresh the network’s memory)[[36]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-025-00983-2?error=cookies_not_supported&code=71a0ef84-ae7f-443f-95d7-1b5fd723e79d#:~:text=of%20tasks%20is%20balancing%20the,datasets%20in%20conventional%20machine%20learning). Each approach has pros and cons – regularization can be insufficient for very different tasks, while modular networks need mechanisms to decide when to create new modules[[37]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-025-00983-2?error=cookies_not_supported&code=71a0ef84-ae7f-443f-95d7-1b5fd723e79d#:~:text=studies%20have%20introduced%20various%20approaches%2C,to%20new%20ones%20in%20lifelong). In the LRL framework mentioned, the authors devise a **Bayesian non-parametric** approach to dynamically expand the model’s “knowledge space” as new tasks come, and they integrate **language embeddings** so the agent has a semantic understanding of tasks (e.g. knowing task descriptions)[[38]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-025-00983-2?error=cookies_not_supported&code=71a0ef84-ae7f-443f-95d7-1b5fd723e79d#:~:text=artificial%20intelligence%20predominantly%20excel%20in,from%20the%20original%20tasks%20stream)[[39]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-025-00983-2?error=cookies_not_supported&code=71a0ef84-ae7f-443f-95d7-1b5fd723e79d#:~:text=we%20enhance%20the%20agent%E2%80%99s%20semantic,of%20more%20broadly%20applicable%20intelligence). This helped their robot continuously learn a set of manipulation tasks and later combine skills to solve long-horizon problems, all without forgetting how to do the earlier tasks[[40]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-025-00983-2?error=cookies_not_supported&code=71a0ef84-ae7f-443f-95d7-1b5fd723e79d#:~:text=lifelong%20reinforcement%20learning%20framework%20that,of%20more%20broadly%20applicable%20intelligence)[[34]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-025-00983-2?error=cookies_not_supported&code=71a0ef84-ae7f-443f-95d7-1b5fd723e79d#:~:text=illustrates%20the%20training%20process%20for,consistently%20accumulating%20knowledge%20and%20skills).

*Figure 1: Concept of a lifelong learning agent. (a) Instead of training on all tasks simultaneously, the agent learns tasks* *sequentially, one after another,* *accumulating knowledge* *along the way. (b) Later, given a high-level goal (e.g. via language instruction), the agent can* *combine* *its previously learned skills to accomplish complex, long-horizon tasks*[*[35]*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-025-00983-2/figures/1?error=cookies_not_supported&code=58da2cba-6f41-4c61-9db1-cfb1cbe4e497#:~:text=a%2C%20Overview%20illustration%20of%20the,and%20reapplication%20of%20acquired%20knowledge)*. This approach emulates a human’s learning trajectory, where skills acquired early in life form building blocks for later challenges.*

**Meta-Learning:** Another strategy to facilitate Stage 3 is **meta-learning**, often described as “learning to learn.” Meta-learning algorithms train the agent on a distribution of tasks such that it can adapt to a new task much faster than a model trained from scratch on that task. In our analogy, meta-learning would endow the AI with a kind of **quick study** ability – like a human who has learned how to effectively study new subjects. One famous meta-learning approach, **MAML (Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning)**, trains a model’s initial parameters so that only a few gradient steps on a new task will yield good performance. In developmental terms, this could be akin to teaching the AI general problem-solving strategies that it can apply to any new challenge. A related idea from robotics is having the AI **self-reflect and explain** its decisions, which ties into Theory of Mind and higher-level cognition (Cangelosi’s work touches on robots developing a form of Theory of Mind to improve collaboration and trust[[41]](https://nam.ai.princeton.edu/events/2025/cognitive-robotics-babies-robots-and-ai#:~:text=approach,of%20Mind%E2%80%99%20of%20people%E2%80%99s%20intention)). While meta-learning is a bit advanced compared to how children explicitly learn, one could argue that humans do develop a form of meta-learning (study habits, abstract thinking strategies) in school, so it is a relevant consideration for an AI’s “education.”

**Knowledge and Reasoning:** By this stage, the AI should also engage in learning from **explicit knowledge sources**, like reading textbooks or querying databases, analogous to how a student learns facts and abstract concepts. This means incorporating **natural language text** at a larger scale (Wikipedia articles, science textbooks, etc.) and possibly formal knowledge (mathematical problems, logic puzzles). The agent might utilize a large language model component (though trained or fine-tuned to remain consistent with the agent’s prior learning experience). However, a caution: large static language models (like GPT-3) are trained on massive data far beyond a human’s experience, which conflicts with our “from scratch, human-paced” philosophy. Instead, one might incrementally increase the agent’s reading corpus over time – perhaps starting with simple stories or educational material for children and ramping up to more complex texts. This ensures the agent’s knowledge base grows in a controlled manner. Indeed, curriculum learning can be applied not just to skills but also to content difficulty. As noted in the BabyLM Challenge, an effective strategy was to **order training data by difficulty**, for example starting with simple sentences and gradually introducing more complex ones[[42]](https://www.thetransmitter.org/neuroai/the-babylm-challenge-in-search-of-more-efficient-learning-algorithms-researchers-look-to-infants/#:~:text=ne%20of%20the%20popular%20approaches,new%20take%20on%20curriculum%20learning). One team even crafted a word-level curriculum (introducing parts of speech in stages), inspired by how children first learn nouns and verbs before grasping function words; this yielded improved language model performance under low-data conditions[[20]](https://www.thetransmitter.org/neuroai/the-babylm-challenge-in-search-of-more-efficient-learning-algorithms-researchers-look-to-infants/#:~:text=Rather%20than%20ordering%20text%20by,They%20found)[[43]](https://www.thetransmitter.org/neuroai/the-babylm-challenge-in-search-of-more-efficient-learning-algorithms-researchers-look-to-infants/#:~:text=Why%20does%20this%20word,example%2C%20despite%20large%20cultural%20differences).

**Outcomes:** Upon completing Stage 3, the AI agent should approximate an **autonomous, educated adult** (at least in narrow AI terms). It would be capable of conversing on a wide range of topics, learning new skills on the fly, and performing complex tasks that require planning and integration of modalities. For example, the matured agent might read an instruction manual (language), then enter a virtual kitchen (vision) and successfully assemble a new recipe (action), asking clarification questions if needed (dialogue). It would continually learn from each new task, updating itself without re-training from scratch. This is obviously an ambitious end-goal, not fully realized by today’s AI. Even Gato, as impressive as it is, “**cannot learn continuously**” and has a fixed knowledge of the world from its training data[[44]](https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/13/deepminds-new-ai-can-perform-over-600-tasks-from-playing-games-to-controlling-robots/#:~:text=Assuming%20this%20turns%20out%20to,are%20it%20would%20respond%20incorrectly). Our developmental approach aims to overcome this by explicitly designing for continuity of learning. Success can be measured by the agent’s adaptability: how quickly can it acquire an unfamiliar skill in testing, and does it retain prior skills? Additionally, one can benchmark the agent on **multi-domain evaluation suites** (for instance, testing language understanding, vision, robotics, and reasoning in one go). If Stage 3 is done well, the agent would not necessarily exceed specialized models in every task, but it would be far more **flexible**. In the words of one researcher, if you believe in the need for generally capable systems, a model that can juggle many tasks (even if not perfectly) is “a big deal”[[45]](https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/13/deepminds-new-ai-can-perform-over-600-tasks-from-playing-games-to-controlling-robots/#:~:text=But%20on%20450%20of%20the,more%20than%20half%20the%20time). The trade-off observed is that a generalist may be smaller and more efficient than many separate specialists – DeepMind’s Gato had only 1.2B parameters (far less than GPT-3’s 175B) yet could do 450+ tasks at a decent level[[46]](https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/13/deepminds-new-ai-can-perform-over-600-tasks-from-playing-games-to-controlling-robots/#:~:text=Image%3A%20DeepMind%20GatoThe%20various%20tasks,Image%20Credits%3A%20DeepMind)[[47]](https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/13/deepminds-new-ai-can-perform-over-600-tasks-from-playing-games-to-controlling-robots/#:~:text=skill%20of%20the%20system%20on,has%20more%20than%20170%20billion). For our AI, being *lifelong-learning enabled* would mean it can keep getting better with experience, potentially reaching super-human breadth of knowledge over time, while maintaining human-like learning efficiency.

## Architecture Choices and Training Frameworks

Designing an architecture for an agent that spans all these stages is challenging. A logical approach is a **modular architecture** that reflects the stages: for example, a **vision module** (trained in Stage 1), an **auditory language module** (trained in Stage 2), and a **cognitive reasoning module** (Stage 3). However, these should not remain wholly separate – ultimately the modules need to interact as one integrated system (much like the human brain’s sensory and prefrontal regions form a cohesive whole). Modern practice leans toward using **Transformer-based architectures** as the backbone for multimodal integration. Transformers have proven remarkably versatile; a single transformer model can take mixed inputs (text, image patches, audio tokens) and handle them jointly, enabling cross-modal attention (e.g. attending to an image region when processing a word)[[8]](https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/13/deepminds-new-ai-can-perform-over-600-tasks-from-playing-games-to-controlling-robots/#:~:text=Curiously%2C%20from%20an%20architectural%20standpoint%2C,images%20and%20analyzing%20protein%20sequences). Many recent multimodal AI systems (like CLIP and Flamingo from OpenAI/DeepMind, or PaLM-E from Google) use a transformer to fuse visual and textual streams. In the context of our developmental AI, we could start with separate networks (e.g. a CNN for vision, a transformer for language) and then in Stage 2–3 either *merge* them via a common transformer or use techniques like **adapter layers** to connect modalities. Notably, DeepMind’s Gato uses a single transformer decoder to handle all tasks by serializing different inputs into a flat sequence[[30]](https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/13/deepminds-new-ai-can-perform-over-600-tasks-from-playing-games-to-controlling-robots/#:~:text=Like%20all%20AI%20systems%2C%20Gato,sentence%20might%20make%20grammatical%20sense). This “single brain” approach is appealing for simplicity and may encourage the model to find general internal representations that apply across tasks[[48]](https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/13/deepminds-new-ai-can-perform-over-600-tasks-from-playing-games-to-controlling-robots/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CMost%20current%20AI%20systems%20work,Gato%2C%20told%20TechCrunch%20via%20email). On the other hand, a strict transformer might not be ideal for certain low-level perception (where CNNs excel) or continuous control (where RNNs or reinforcement learning policies are common). Thus, a **hybrid architecture** could be beneficial – for instance, use convolutional layers to preprocess images and audio into token embeddings, then feed those along with text tokens into a transformer that does higher-level reasoning. The architecture should also support **memory** (to simulate learning over time). This could involve adding a replay buffer or a long-short-term memory component to store past experiences, or even an external knowledge base the agent can consult (like an episodic memory module that accumulates facts).

When it comes to training frameworks and tools, **Python-based deep learning libraries** are indispensable. **PyTorch** is the most widely used in research for its flexibility and large ecosystem, which would be helpful for implementing custom multi-stage training loops. PyTorch’s dynamic computation graph makes it easier to do things like curriculum learning, where the model’s tasks and data sources change over time. **TensorFlow** (particularly with Keras) is another option; it’s more mature in production settings but slightly less popular for cutting-edge research nowadays. That said, TensorFlow can certainly handle a multi-modal model and has strong support for distributed training if needed. **JAX/Flax** is a newer player that Google researchers favor for its speed and the ease of implementing novel algorithms (thanks to function transformations for grad, vectorization, etc.). JAX could be useful if you need to optimize custom training updates (say, meta-learning gradients or fast batch adaptation) thanks to its composability. However, PyTorch likely offers more pretrained components (e.g. CNN backbones, transformer language models) which could bootstrap parts of the system if one doesn’t start entirely from scratch.

Beyond the core deep learning library, specialized toolkits will help at each stage:

- **For vision (Stage 1):** Libraries like OpenCV can assist in image processing and augmentations. PyTorch’s Torchvision or OpenAI’s CLIP model weights might be used to initialize perception if not strictly starting from a blank slate. Self-supervised learning frameworks (e.g. PyTorch Lightning Flash, or research code for contrastive learning) could accelerate the visual pretraining process.

- **For speech (Stage 2):** If training from raw audio, one might use libraries like Librosa for audio loading and feature extraction, or torchaudio. There are also pretrained speech recognition models (like wav2vec 2.0) that could be adapted or at least guide the architecture design. However, an interesting idea is to avoid going through text transcripts at all and train an **audio-visual embedding** space directly – recent work on “speech-image alignment” indicates AI can learn to associate spoken words with images without ever converting the speech to text, which is analogous to how infants learn words before they can read. This can be implemented via contrastive learning (making the model bring together the embeddings of an image and its corresponding audio snippet, and push apart mismatched pairs).

- **For multi-task cognition (Stage 3):** We will likely lean on **reinforcement learning (RL)** libraries for interactive tasks. For instance, if the agent learns by doing in a simulated environment (more on environments in the next section), frameworks like **OpenAI Gym** and **RLlib** or stable-baselines3 can be used to manage training loops and reward calculation. If the tasks include classic NLP or knowledge questions, the **Hugging Face Transformers** library is invaluable – it provides implementations of transformers that can be fine-tuned on QA, summarization, etc., which might correspond to some of the “school” tasks we give the agent. Moreover, Hugging Face’s datasets library includes many multitask and knowledge datasets, which can be useful to script a curriculum (e.g. start with elementary-level QA, move to high-school-level QA, etc.).

**Curriculum & Orchestration:** Orchestrating the whole process requires a flexible training pipeline. One might build a custom **curriculum scheduler** that controls when the agent is exposed to which data or environment. This could be rule-based (e.g. train Stage 1 for X epochs, then unlock Stage 2) or performance-based (move to the next stage when certain criteria are met, like “object recognition accuracy > 80%”). There has been research into automated curriculum learning – allowing the agent to choose its own next challenge – which could be leveraged. For instance, **intrinsic motivation** mechanisms (as mentioned earlier) might naturally progress the agent into more complex territory without hard-coded schedules.

In summary, the architecture is likely to be **multi-modal and multi-component**, but unified by a high-level design (transformers for integration, perhaps) and the training frameworks will include a combination of deep learning libraries (PyTorch/TF) and simulation environments or data pipelines. The entire system can be considered a form of **Developmental AI**, an approach that is increasingly tractable thanks to these modern tools and the growing synergy between cognitive science and AI engineering.

## Environments and Platforms for Embodied Development

A crucial aspect of this endeavor is providing the AI agent with an **environment** in which to grow. In human development, the environment includes physical surroundings, social interaction, and sensory stimuli. For our AI, we can leverage both **simulated virtual environments** and curated real-world datasets to serve this role.

**Simulation Environments:** Simulation is extremely useful for developmental AI because it allows safe, rapid, and controllable experimentation. One leading platform is **AI Habitat** by Meta (Facebook)[[49]](https://aihabitat.org/#:~:text=What%20is%20AI%20Habitat%3F). Habitat is a high-performance 3D simulator for **embodied AI**, especially suited for indoor navigation and interaction tasks. It offers photorealistic 3D home environments (scanned from real buildings) and supports a physics engine and configurable sensors (RGB cameras, depth sensors, etc.)[[50]](https://aihabitat.org/#:~:text=A%20high,with%20support%20for)[[51]](https://aihabitat.org/#:~:text=%2A%20Configurable%20sensors%20%28RGB,body%20mechanics%20%28via%20Bullet). With Habitat, one could place a virtual “baby” agent in a simulated house and let it roam around learning (Stage 1: seeing living rooms, kitchens, etc., maybe with objects it can bump into). Later, the same environment can be used for more complex tasks (Stage 3: e.g. “go to the kitchen and fetch an apple” requiring navigation and object recognition). Habitat emphasizes **active perception and navigation**, which is great for an AI that needs to learn by moving and looking around, analogous to how a toddler crawls to explore[[52]](https://aihabitat.org/#:~:text=This%20empowers%20a%20paradigm%20shift,dialog%20grounded%20in%20an%20environment). Another advantage is speed: Habitat is optimized to run much faster than real-time and can even parallelize across multiple instances, meaning the agent can experience years of play within hours of actual time[[53]](https://aihabitat.org/#:~:text=,or%20experiments%20is%20often%20difficult)[[54]](https://aihabitat.org/#:~:text=Simulations%20can%20run%20orders%20of,be%20transferred%20to%20physical%20platforms). This addresses the otherwise slow pace of real developmental time.

**Game Engines (Unity):** For more flexibility, **Unity ML-Agents** is an excellent toolkit. Unity allows designing arbitrary scenarios with physics, visuals, and even social agents. Using Unity, one could create a **nursery room** with toys for Stage 1, where the AI (as an embodied avatar or just a camera agent) can manipulate blocks or watch mobiles spin. For Stage 2, one could script **NPC characters** (non-player characters) in Unity that speak to the agent using text-to-speech, enabling interactive language learning in a controlled storybook-like world. For example, a Unity scene might have a mother figure that points at objects and names them (“This is a ball”) while the agent’s task is to attend and later recall the name. Unity ML-Agents provides the bridge to train ML models in such environments using Python; it supports reinforcement learning and imitation learning out of the box[[55]](https://huggingface.co/learn/deep-rl-course/en/unit5/how-mlagents-works#:~:text=How%20do%20Unity%20ML,environments%20to%20train%20our%20agents). It also supports **curriculum learning setups** where the environment difficulty can increase once the agent succeeds consistently[[56]](https://medium.com/data-science/curriculum-learning-with-unity-ml-agents-c8e7a1aa5415#:~:text=Curriculum%20Learning%20With%20Unity%20ML,Agents%20and%20curriculum%20learning). Another scenario for Stage 3 could be a **classroom simulation** in Unity, where the agent has to solve puzzles on a chalkboard or answer quiz questions posed by a teacher avatar. The possibilities are quite open-ended, and Unity’s rich 3D environments could integrate visual, auditory (Unity can play sounds or speech), and even social cues (emotes, gestures by characters) to provide a holistic training ground.

**Textual and Other Environments:** Not all interactions need high-fidelity 3D. The **BabyAI** platform, as discussed, is a 2D gridworld with a synthetic language – its simplicity is a strength for research because it allows rapid iteration on language learning algorithms without the complexity of real visuals[[26]](https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJeXCo0cYX#:~:text=BabyAI%20research%20platform%2C%20with%20the,efficient%20in%20the). One might use BabyAI in early Stage 2 as a sandbox for developing the agent’s basic language understanding in an **instruction-following context**. After the agent “graduates” from BabyAI (so to speak), it can be transferred into a richer 3D world or real-world scenario. There are also text-based environments like **TextWorld** or interactive fiction, which could be useful in Stage 3 to practice reading comprehension and problem-solving through language alone (imagine an AI playing a text adventure game as a form of reasoning training).

**Embodiment vs. Datasets:** It’s worth noting that throughout training, we can mix **learning from interaction** (in simulations) with **learning from data** (recorded datasets). Stage 1, for instance, might mostly use video data (like SAYCam, or others such as the **Ego4D** dataset – 3,000 hours of first-person video from adult life, which could complement infant video to provide diverse visual scenes). Stage 3 might involve reading large text corpora in addition to performing tasks in a sim. Blending these ensures the agent gains both *breadth* of knowledge (from offline data) and *grounded skill* (from active environment interaction). Notably, the NIH Baby Toolbox tasks we mentioned are implemented by converting datasets into simulated “experiences” for the AI – e.g. showing an image and playing an audio clip as a trial[[57]](https://www.emergentmind.com/topics/nih-baby-toolbox#:~:text=receptive%20language.%20,response%2C%20counting%2C%20and%20spatial%20discrimination)[[4]](https://www.emergentmind.com/topics/nih-baby-toolbox#:~:text=Visual%20Delayed%20Response%20Video,prediction). So one can use real recordings in a simulated playback to the agent, achieving a mix of realism and interaction.

**Physical Robots and Transfer:** Eventually, if one wants the AI to exist in the physical world, simulators like Habitat and Unity are designed to ease **transfer to real robots**[[58]](https://aihabitat.org/#:~:text=AI%20Habitat%20enables%20training%20of,the%20learned%20skills%20to%20reality)[[59]](https://aihabitat.org/#:~:text=egocentric%20assistants,the%20learned%20skills%20to%20reality). Habitat’s rationale is that an agent trained in a realistic simulator can then be deployed in a real robot with minimal adjustment, thanks to the simulation’s high fidelity[[60]](https://aihabitat.org/#:~:text=Our%20goal%20is%20to%20advance,I%20last%20see%20my%20keys%3F%E2%80%9D)[[52]](https://aihabitat.org/#:~:text=This%20empowers%20a%20paradigm%20shift,dialog%20grounded%20in%20an%20environment). For example, an agent that learns to navigate and pick objects in Habitat’s virtual replica of a house could potentially control a real domestic robot in an actual house with the same skills. This goes beyond the scope of initial training, but it’s a consideration for “lifelong learning” if we envision the AI continuing to learn in the real world post-training.

In conclusion, a combination of **virtual playgrounds** (like Unity for flexible scenarios, Habitat for realistic navigation, BabyAI for abstract puzzles) and carefully chosen **developmental datasets** (SAYCam for infant experiences, CHILDES/BabyLM data for language, etc.) will form the backbone of the AI’s learning environment. This ensures the AI has rich, progressively challenging experiences from “birth” to “adulthood.” Just as important as the algorithmic choices is crafting these experiences to be **age-appropriate for the AI** at each stage – too simple and the AI won’t learn much, too difficult and it might fail to progress. The research projects we surveyed, from virtual infants like BabyX to toddler-level robots and multi-task agents, all stress the value of **gradual learning with the right environment**. By leveraging these tools and insights, we can chart a plausible path for training a general AI agent that grows up much like a human, acquiring perception, then language, then the vast tapestry of knowledge – **a truly developmental AI**.

## Summary and Outlook

We have outlined a comprehensive plan to train an AI agent through stages analogous to human development:

- **Stage 1 (Infancy):** Focus on vision and basic sensorimotor understanding. Using egocentric visual data and possibly simulated playrooms, the AI learns to perceive objects, spaces, and simple physical laws, building core representations of its world[[9]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9489531/#:~:text=and%20machines%20by%20drawing%20on,both%20for%20AI%20and%20for)[[10]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9489531/#:~:text=Piloto%20et%20al,as%20object%20solidity%20and%20persistence).

- **Stage 2 (Childhood):** Emphasize language and social learning. The AI is exposed to child-directed speech and multimodal interactions, allowing it to associate words with concepts and engage in simple dialogue[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BabyX#:~:text=reacts%20like%20a%20human%20baby,4)[[24]](https://neurosciencenews.com/ai-toddler-learning-28382/#:~:text=prompt). Techniques like multimodal transformers and interactive training with a teacher help the agent acquire communication skills grounded in its perceptions[[7]](https://neurosciencenews.com/ai-toddler-learning-28382/#:~:text=By%20contrast%2C%20the%20new%20model,%E2%80%9D)[[26]](https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJeXCo0cYX#:~:text=BabyAI%20research%20platform%2C%20with%20the,efficient%20in%20the).

- **Stage 3 (School and Beyond):** Advance to complex cognition, knowledge accumulation, and lifelong learning. The AI tackles diverse tasks across domains, leveraging curriculum learning and transfer to continuously broaden its expertise[[28]](https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/13/deepminds-new-ai-can-perform-over-600-tasks-from-playing-games-to-controlling-robots/#:~:text=Gato%20is%20what%20DeepMind%20describes,arm%20and%20playing%20Atari%20games)[[33]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-025-00983-2?error=cookies_not_supported&code=71a0ef84-ae7f-443f-95d7-1b5fd723e79d#:~:text=the%20lack%20of%20lifelong%20learning,framework%20that%20is%20well%20suited). Architectures and strategies here (multi-task transformers, meta-learning, continual learning frameworks) enable the agent to learn sequentially without forgetting, much like a student progressing through grades and then learning on the job[[35]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-025-00983-2/figures/1?error=cookies_not_supported&code=58da2cba-6f41-4c61-9db1-cfb1cbe4e497#:~:text=a%2C%20Overview%20illustration%20of%20the,and%20reapplication%20of%20acquired%20knowledge)[[36]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-025-00983-2?error=cookies_not_supported&code=71a0ef84-ae7f-443f-95d7-1b5fd723e79d#:~:text=of%20tasks%20is%20balancing%20the,datasets%20in%20conventional%20machine%20learning).

Throughout these stages, a variety of **projects and research efforts** provide guidance and validation: from developmental robotics experiments with baby-like robots[[2]](https://nam.ai.princeton.edu/events/2025/cognitive-robotics-babies-robots-and-ai#:~:text=collaboration,Theory%20of%20Mind%20and%20its), to virtual infant simulations like BabyX[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BabyX#:~:text=reacts%20like%20a%20human%20baby,4), to generalist models like Gato that hint at multi-skill integration[[28]](https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/13/deepminds-new-ai-can-perform-over-600-tasks-from-playing-games-to-controlling-robots/#:~:text=Gato%20is%20what%20DeepMind%20describes,arm%20and%20playing%20Atari%20games), and benchmarks like the BabyLM Challenge that promote efficient, human-like language learning[[17]](https://www.thetransmitter.org/neuroai/the-babylm-challenge-in-search-of-more-efficient-learning-algorithms-researchers-look-to-infants/#:~:text=This%20question%20is%20the%20inspiration,test%20set%20to%20assess%20performance)[[61]](https://www.thetransmitter.org/neuroai/the-babylm-challenge-in-search-of-more-efficient-learning-algorithms-researchers-look-to-infants/#:~:text=O). This indicates a growing convergence on the idea that **AI can benefit from a developmental paradigm** – not just learning tasks in isolation, but in a progressive, life-long manner.

Finally, we discussed the **tools and environments** that make this endeavor feasible. High-fidelity simulators (Unity, Habitat) and curated developmental datasets (SAYCam, CHILDES, etc.) form the rich environment an AI “childhood” requires. Modern deep learning frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX) and algorithms (reinforcement learning, self-supervised learning, etc.) are the vehicles by which we implement this curriculum.

In summary, training a general AI model from “birth” to “adulthood” is an ambitious but increasingly tractable goal. It requires careful staging of learning experiences, just as one would design a school curriculum, and a unified yet flexible architecture that can grow with the agent. By imitating the human developmental journey, we not only aim to create an AI that is **multimodal and autonomous** but also gain scientific insights into learning itself. As one article aptly put it, even a 18-month-old child can outlearn current AI in many ways – but by **watching, imitating, and extrapolating** like a child[[62]](https://singularityhub.com/2015/12/13/how-baby-babble-can-lead-to-sophisticated-ai/#:~:text=Designing%20Robots%20That%20Learn%20as,they%20imitate%3B%20and%20they%20extrapolate)[[63]](https://nam.ai.princeton.edu/events/2025/cognitive-robotics-babies-robots-and-ai#:~:text=During%20the%20talk%20we%20will,One%20study), future AI may bridge that gap. The outcome of this research direction could be an AI that engages with the world in a truly human-like way: seeing, hearing, and learning **endlessly and adaptively throughout its lifespan**.
